In this work, the article Predicting Dynamic Embedding Trajectory in Temporal Interaction Networks [1] is evaluated through a replication study. Replication results examine whether the claims made by the authors are valid. Our goal is to replicate the experiments and achieve the same results as the authors. Our code used for the replication is available at the following address: [https://github.com/ComplexNetTSP/JODIE](https://github.com/ComplexNetTSP/JODIE).
